<!-- TODO list libraries/tutorials/code sources that you used (including links) â€“ in particular, please point out files wherein the code was not implemented by you. -->

## libraries
The code was implemented in Python. The following libraries where used:
* [pyaudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/) to play laod and sounds
* RPI.GPIO to control the RasPis pins
* wave to work with the samples in .wav format
* [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) for calculations
* os to work with filepaths
* copy to duplicate objects

## code sources
Stackoverflow was used to look up some syntax for some concepts, when loading the samples. 
The examples from [pyaudio documentation](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/docs/) was used as a basis for playing audio and then modified to play the samples in the way we wanted.
