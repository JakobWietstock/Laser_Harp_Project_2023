7min. Anscheinend keine Verwendung des Prototyps intended

Team members: Who are you?
Wie letztes mal

Project idea: What is your topic? Who is your product for?
Laser harp, ...


What were your goals? What requirements did you have?
Playable with your hands by breaking lasers 
7 basic notes
2 octaves
5 halftones each

visual feedback for disrupting lasers


Development progress throughout the course, including challenges and how you overcame them:

*****Reihenfolge angepasst*********
    Explain your initial concept based on your sketches/storyboards, and cardboard/paper/clay prototypes



    How did you evaluate your prototype, with whom, and what were the results? You should report both on the early peer evaluation in class, and the later evaluation with your target group.
        early
        mit David + teammate
        Kritik:
        Lob:

        Daraus folgendes nächstes Design:
        Design sieht aus wie Harfe für intuitive Nutzung



        
        

   

        What parts of your initial concept were achieved? Which weren’t?
        ...

         Highlight the interaction features of your final prototype.
    lasers
    Octave-switch, sharp-button, volume selector


    Make sure to include video clip(s), showing your final product in action (i.e., being user/interacted with by a user)
    Anschalten durch einstecken, LED checken, Lautstärke verändern, Spielen, dabei Oktave + Halbtöne zeigen
    evt Video mit erkennbarem Musikstück produzieren.

    How did you build your prototype? What Electronics, components, materials,.. were used (e.g. for casing). What tools did you use?
    Light sensors, Lasers
    raspberry pi, python
    speakers powered via usb raspi
    power strip inside
    2 raspberries for power supply 
    Wooden frame from the workshop
        pre-drilled and screwed together by us


*****Reihenfolge angepasst ENDE*********

Lessons learned, outlook
    Experience in the group
    Our areas of expertise and interest matched up quite well
    bigger group harder time management

    What did you learn in this course?
    people really like soldering
    Electronics, Raspberry Pi Programming, Things often don't go your way (Software but especially hardware), always have backup plan, 
    Whatever can go wrong will go wrong.

    What limitations does your final device have? How could you improve upon your design in future iterations?
    laser aiming is implemented rather amateurish (playdoo)
    No flat-key (not needed for prototype because enharmonic equivalence)
    sound can't resemble instruments 


    What would you have done differently in retrospect?
    started earlier with ordering and building
    planning some things out more and having an alternative plan
