# Physical Computing WS22 - Group 1

## Who we are

### Cedric Krug

I study Computer Science as an undergrad in my 5th Semester. This course was recommended to me by students who took it last semester. I am especially looking forward to actually create a program that interacts with hardware and the real world, since the programming we usually do in Uni is quite theoretical.  
In my free time I like to program and play video games as well as volleyball.

Like Cedric I study Computer Science as an undergrad in my 5th Semester. I really look forward to work on a project like that because it is something I would normally do in my free time if it weren't for the lack of materials and free time. Another reason I took this course is to learn skills I have wanted to learn for some time, like working with an arduino or 3D printer.
â€‹I spend most of my free time with friends or doing sport or jogging.

I study the Master Computer and Information Science in my 2nd Semester. In this course i look forward to create a functioning physical endproduct that integrates software, hardware and other moving parts, since its a rare opportunity to desingn and build something physical from the ground up in a university environment.

## Topic

We build a laser harp, a harp that can be played by disrupting lasers.

## Repository Structure

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `Project` | Everything related to your project. |
| `Project/Concept` | Everything related to the concept or design of your project (ideas, drawings, mockups, mind maps, etc.). |
| `Project/Electronics` | Everything related to the electronics of your project (circuit diagrams, datasheets, etc.). |
| `Project/Mechanical` | Everything related to the mechanical aspect of your project (CAD, blueprints, datasheets, assembly, etc.). |
| `Project/Software` | The software aspect of your project. Most likely source code. |
| `Weekly Reports` | Weekly status updates as Markdown files. |
| `Weekly Reports/Figures` | Pictures or videos for your weekly reports. |

## Weekly Reports

Create a file called `PhysComp SS/WS<YY> Group <X> Week <N>.md` for every weekly report in `Weekly Reports`. For example: `PhysComp WS22 Group 2 Week 3.md`.
If you include pictures of videos, put them in `Weekly Reports/Figures`.

## Repository

### LFS

This template already comes with a pre-defined configuration for [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/). If you add any large binary files to your repository, update `.gitattributes` accordingly using `git lfs track`. For example if you add other video formats or CAD files that are binary, you need to track their file extension.

### .gitgnore

Please create according `.gitignore` files to ignore unnecessary files in the repository such as temporary files or build artifacts.
