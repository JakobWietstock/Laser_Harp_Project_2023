# Physical Computing WS22 - Group 1

## Who we are

### Cedric Krug

I study Computer Science as an undergrad in my 5th Semester. This course was recommended to me by students who took it last semester. I am especially looking forward to actually create a program that interacts with hardware and the real world, since the programming we usually do in Uni is quite theoretical.  
In my free time I like to program and play video games as well as volleyball.

Like Cedric I study Computer Science as an undergrad in my 5th Semester. I really look forward to work on a project like that because it is something I would normally do in my free time if it weren't for the lack of materials and free time. Another reason I took this course is to learn skills I have wanted to learn for some time, like working with an arduino or 3D printer.
â€‹I spend most of my free time with friends or doing sport or jogging.

I study the Master Computer and Information Science in my 2nd Semester. In this course i look forward to create a functioning physical endproduct that integrates software, hardware and other moving parts, since its a rare opportunity to desingn and build something physical from the ground up in a university environment.

## Topic

We build a laser harp, a harp that can be played by disrupting lasers. The detailed design process can be viewed in Weekly Reports.
