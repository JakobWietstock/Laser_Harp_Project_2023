# PhysComp WS 2022/23 Group 01 - Week 03

## Progress Report

### What we achieved this week

We created our first sketches of the product. We mostly thought about how to design the instrument in a way that makes it possible to at least play easy melodies.  
We agreed on the harp to have 7 strings/lasers making it possible to play an entire octave (c,d,e,f,g,a,h). 

### First sketches
 
The harp would include an on-/off-button that also works as a volume control.  
There would be a switch to decide on which of the two playable octaaves you are, giving you a wider range to play at.  
The lasers would go from the bottom to the top, at the top there would be sensors to check if the laser is interrupted.  
An interrupt would lead to the inbuild speaker playing the correct sound.

The storyboard shows how Bob would interact with the harp. The harp has a very simple design that would allow even casual users such as Bob to use it. The basic usage of the laser harp by breaking the correct laser beams, thereby alarming a light sensor, is demonstrated. Different "features" like the ON-/OFF-switch, the volume control and the octave switch are shown.

### Idea Collection

We made a photograph of a piano and highlighted an octave. The laser harp will probably feature seven laser rays going from c to h (usually called b outside of germany), similar to one octave of a piano.  
Harps usually have way more strings, but it

This picture show a full piano keyboard, containing seven octaves. This shows the huge tone range normal instruments have. We will need to implement some way to switch between octaves to make even simple songs possible, but will obviously stay way behind actual instruments.

This image shows something similar to the second picture but this time for an actual harp. Since we dont't have access to a harp irl we had to download it from the internet. Again the tone range of a real harp is way beyond anything we could hope to implement, having 6 octaves.

Some gates espacially parking gates use laser sensors to detected cars so they know when the car is gone and can close in all safety. Our harp would use the laser sensor to sense if a finger is currently blocking the ray and therefore

At first I dint know at all where to get a picyure of switches while I was sitting at my desk than I saw that my desk-lamp has a switch, than I noticed that my LED sign has a switch too and my power outlett too. Switches are all around us and so easy and fast to use that we easily forget about them. a second great thing about switches is that since they normaly have two different positions they also indicate a state. this is helpfull to know if somthing is working or not. When my power outlet switch is on but my phone still not charging there should be something wrong with my chager or cable.
on the harp this could help to know if it should be working now even when you cant see the lasers.

### What we could not achieve this week
We mostly finished our sketches after class since we spend most of the lab time discussing the basic design of the instrument.


### What we plan to do for the coming week

For this week we plan to make more sketches of our project. We will also try to improve the design and think of different alternative designs. We also plan to build our first prototype(s) to better come up with improvements and see how the human interaction with the laser harp is working to know what we should improve in our design. We will create a basic shopping list for the parts we will need to build our project.

Questions we have to ask ourself are:  
- How can you play a wide range of notes while still staying user friendly and intuitive even for beginners?
- How can we make the lasers visible so the user can play the notes he wants?
- How can we play decent sound with relatively low quality hardware?
