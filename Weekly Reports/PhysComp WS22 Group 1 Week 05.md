# PhysComp WS 2022/23 Group 01 - Week 05

## Progress Report

### What we achieved this week

We started on the soldering exercise. We switched with the soldering after each component so that each group member got to do it at least once, and could gain some experince.

Since Dodo had the most recent experince with soldering, he showed the rest of the group how to do it.

### What we could not achieve this week

We didn't finish the soldering exercise because we ran out of time.

### What we plan to do for the coming week

We already created a new sketch based on both the feedback from the presentation and our own ideas.  
We will look at our order list and look for specific parts we could order.


## Feedback from presentation and possible solutions

* Haptic or visual feedback regarding the location of the lasers
  * Our initial idea is to integrate a smoke machine that would make the lasers visible
  * another option would be to use compressed air or ultrasound for haptic feedback
* Which note does each "string" play
  * We will label each laser accordingly. You can see this in the new sketch
* Transportability of the harp
  * Especially if we integrate a smoke machine the harp will need an additional power supply meaning it's not easily played in any location
  * We will most likely increase the size of our prototype since the lasers being farther apart would make the harp easier to use, this would also hamper transportability



## New improved Sketch

* The size of this version of our project will be slightly bigger so the lasers are more spaced out and you won't accidentally play two notes at once.  
* We will label the lasers according to the notes you can play with them.  
* The harp can now be played from two sides (it's open on both sides), which makes it easier to play and shows the audience what you are doing.  
* The octave selection has been turned into a button that needs to be pressed down once to change to the higher octave and then stays in a lowered position until it's pressed down again and the octave is switched back to the lower/base one.  
* There now is a built in smoke machine that makes the lasers visible.

A first electronical circuit plan (without bouttons or sound output):

We are currently unsure about:
- small smoke machine
- multiple color lasers (blue,green)
