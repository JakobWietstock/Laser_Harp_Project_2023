# PhysComp WS 2022/23 Group 01 - Week 07

## Progress Report

### What we achieved this week
We designed a nice cup in CAD to not drink tea out of.
You can fint the *.stp file for the mug [here](https://gitlab.inf.uni-konstanz.de/ag-hci/lectures/physical-computing/2022-23-physical-computing/phys-comp-ws-22-group-1/-/blob/main/Exercises/mug_group_01.stp).

We also set up the Raspberry Pi, and ordered parts we are going to need.

### Challenges faced
Getting Fusion 360 to work on our laptops proved to be difficult. The program had excessive loading time and wouldn't start at all on Cedrics machine. 
The controlls of the Program where also challanging to understand for beginners like ourselves. Our Raspberry Pi also showed some weird behavior because of a wrong power supply. This should be fixed by using an official power supply.


### What we could not achieve this week

### What we plan to do for the coming week
We are going to begin Implementing the necessary code for the functions of the harp. We are also starting to design the frame and socket plans, to give to the university workshop. 

## Upcoming
### Minimum viable product
* the harp should have a frame
* the harp should have a button or switch to turn it on and off
* the smoke machine doesn't need to be included yet
* there are 7 lasers and light receptors in the frame and the correct note is being played when one of them is disrupted
* disrupting two lasers at a time and other edge cases are appropriately handled

### Milestones

* Milestone 1: Preparations are Completed 14.12.2022
	* All parts are ordered, the final design is decided and the Raspberry Pi is set up.
* Milestone 2: Software Completed 01.01.2023
	* The necessary implementaiton is completed. 
	* The lasers produce sound when disturbed.
	* the button allows switching between octaves.
	* the smoke machine is controlled by the RasPi.
	* the on/off dial allows control of the volume.
* Milestone 3: Prototype completed and evaluation planned 18.01.2023
	* The harp is constructed, all parts are set up within the frame. There is a finished plan to evaluate the prototype.
* Milestone 4: Prototype evaluation 25.01.2023
	* The prototype has been evaluated. Weaknesses in its design are identified. A plan stands to refine the prototype.
* Milestone 5: Final Presentation 07.02.2023
	* The prototype has been refined enough to show of in the final presentation. The presentaion is prepared.
* Milestone 6: Final Submission 14.02.2023
	* The refinement is completed. The harp is ready to be submitted.

	TODO Reihenfolge und Daten
* Milestone 1: xx.xx.xxxx
  * we wrote software and connected the hardware with the raspberry pi so that disrupting the lasers causes different sounds to be played depending on the laser that is disrupted
* Milestone 2: xx.xx.xxxx
  * the frame and the socket is designed and the design is given to the university's workshops
* Milestone 3: xx.xx.xxxx
  * we succesfully installed Raspberry Pi OS on our Raspberry and did the rest of the setup
* Milestone 4: xx.xx.xxxx
  *
