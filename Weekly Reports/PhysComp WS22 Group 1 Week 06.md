# PhysComp WS 2022/23 Group 01 - Week 06

## Progress Report

### What we achieved this week

We build a new prototype following the sketch we put in the last weekly.

<img src="./Figures/arc_mount_01.jpg"
     width = "300px"
     style="margin-right: 10px;" />
     

* The new prototype has the octave button on the frame.  
* It also has a plug for the included smoke machine, which makes the lasers visible.  
* The "strings" are now labelled with the notes they represent

     width = "300px"
     style="margin-right: 10px;" />

* The harp can now be played from both side, also making it more accessible to left-handers.

The new prototype was peer-reviewed. See more in section: Feedback  

### What we could not achieve this week

### What we plan to do for the coming week
We paln eo start with ordering and implementation.



## Feedback
see in section most important Feedback received.
 
Feedback given to: Group 03, Description:  
* They build a store where you can by drinks and maybe snacks with an electronic card. Feedback:
  * It should be clearer where you put the card
  * The product should contain a barcode scanner so you don't have to select your order every time
  * You should also be able to select your order manually, if for example the barcode is washed off
  * Creating statistics of what is bought most often often etc could be useful
Group TODO(David), Description:  
* They build an alarm clock that forces you to play oldschool Mario Bros and only stops once you finished the level. Feedback:
 
- Totally well thought out.
- How is the infinite loop broken? (e.g. too stupid for lvl 1?).
- The size is wonderful. Still fits on the nightstand and yet is present.
- Is it possible to tighten the alarm?
- Split of arcade and alarm clock is good and also separate operation was good.
- Tendency to "modern arcade" instead of "old arcade".
that was their feedback to us



### Most important Feedback received

* We could play a sound when the harp turns on, both as feedback that it's now turned on and to check for the currently selected volume level
  * valid feedback that should be implemented easily
* You could select the sound from multiple instruments in a similar way to an E-Piano (for example harp, trombone, organ, bagpipes)
  * something we can implement if we make good progress. Would definitely be funny
* You could separate the harp and smoke machine, or make it possible to turn the smoke machine off independently
  * Separating them would turn it into separate devices which isn't in our interest. However turning the Smoke machine off individually is worth a thought. We will think more about it once we get our smoke machine and start with the implementation
  
### What it was like

We showed them our prototype, they tried it out and gave some feedback.

We still need to look for :

- multiple color lasers (blue,green)
