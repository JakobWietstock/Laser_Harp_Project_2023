# PhysComp WS 2022/23 Group 01 - Week 10

## Progress Report

### What we achieved this week
* We designed the evaluation
* We created the survey on Google Forms
* We measured different parts we are about to use and started with designing the plans we want to give to the University workshop
### Challenges faced
* The plans we give to the workshop will for better or for worse be the final ones so we have to design them in a way that leaves enough room for small errors in our measurements, additional parts being added and other changes
* We will have to figure out a way to close the top of the frame. This can't easily be done by wood since it's curved
* We found out this week that the Uni workshop takes more time than we expected (up to 4 weeks)

### What we could not achieve this week
* As mentioned in challenges we still struggle with some decisions concerning the frame of the harp


### What we plan to do for the coming week
* Finding participants
* We want to finish our plans so the Uni workshop can start working on them as soon as possible
* Doing the Evaluation


## Evaluation plan
We built our Laserharp primarily for Tech enthusiasts that look for a cool and fun gadget to play with. The harp should be used by one user at a time.
Because of this we plan our Evaluation as an Usability Test With at least 3 participants, which will be supplemented by a survey consisting of three questionnaires. We hope to complete building the Prototype before the test, so there should be no Wizard of Ozing involved.
If this is not Possible we could however use the smokemachine manually.

We hope to answer the following Questions with the test:

* How user friendly is the design of the harp.
* Are the controls intuitive?
* Are the control elements placed well?
* Does it work as an actual instrument or is it more of a gadget?
* Is the smoke machine helpful or in the way?
* Is it fun to play?

For the Test the participants will first sign an Informed consent form before answering a demographic questionnaire. They will then perform the following Tasks while using the Think Aloud Technique:

* Turn on the harp
* Try getting the harp to play a sound
* set the volume of the harp to a comfortable pitch
* select the octave you would like to hear
* select the type of sample you want to use
* play the harp for a while(with smoke)
* play the harp for a while(without smoke)

During the test One of us will lead the participants through the tasks. while the others will take notes.

After the tasks have been completed the participants will answer a User experience Questionnaire as introduced by Laugwitz, Held & Schreep.
We chose the UEQ since it comes with supplementary Material which allows us to Benchmark the Prototype against other systems.
Lastly the user will answer one last questionnaire we created ourselves.

The questionnaires can be found at:
