# PhysComp WS 2022/23 Group 01 - Week 01

## Team introduction

### Cedric Krug
I study Computer Science as an undergrad in my 5th Semester. This course was recommended to me by students who took it last semester. I am especially looking forward to actually create a program that interacts with hardware and the real world, since the programming we usually do in Uni is quite theoretical.  
In my free time I like to program and play video games as well as volleyball.

Like Cedric I study Computer Science as an undergrad in my 5th Semester. I really look forward to work on a project like that because it is something I would normally do in my free time if it weren't for the lack of materials and free time. Another reason I took this course is to learn skills I have wanted to learn for some time, like working with an arduino or 3D printer.
â€‹I spend most of my free time with friends or doing sport or jogging.    

### Jakob Wietstock

I study the Master Computer and Information Science in my 2nd Semester. In this course i look forward to create a functioning physical endproduct that integrates software, hardware and other moving parts, since its a rare opportunity to desingn and build something physical from the ground up in a university environment.

## Progress Report

### What we achieved this week
We all successfully installed the Arduino IDE (which took quite some time on Linux), collected all the necessary materials which were not in the provided box (e.g. the 9V battery).  
We started working on the online course but before we build the first "experiment" the lecture time was over.

### What we could not achieve this week
We did not finish the chapters Electronics and Programming because of several challenges we faced (see dedicated section)


### What we plan to do for the coming week
Continue with the ctc go course.

### Challenges faced
- The IDE on Linux was only officially supported as an AppImage, so we first had to figure out how to install it
- Several of the sockets at our table were broken, which led to the destruction of Donatiens laptop charger
- The materials provided with the Arduino weren't complete at all, so we had to go through them and get the ones not in the box.
